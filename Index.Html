         <p>So I will just give you guys the jist of the difference between Java and Javascript.So when we start to tak about the difference between these both programming languages we find that one of the differences is the way these languages are written.
         <p2>The way Javascript is written is in a OOP scripting language, But Java is written in a OOP programming language called C like how oracle is written in C++(OOP is the short form of Object Oriented Programming).</p2>
